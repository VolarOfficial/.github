# Volar

**Modding should be fast, fair, and accessible.**  
We’re building a better platform for creators and their content.

## 🎯 What is Volar?

Volar is a next-gen modding platform designed to make things easier for creators and players alike.  
We focus on speed, clarity, and a better overall experience — no bloat, no nonsense.

We're a closed-source platform, built with care and maintained by a small, dedicated team.
Our goal isn’t to replace the modding scene — just to give it a better home.

> Volar is a subsidiary of [Venoxity Development](https://github.com/Venoxity-Development), a team focused on building practical, creator-first tools and platforms.

## 📁 What We Share

Volar is a modding platform and community hub where creators can upload, manage, and share their work.  
We support game mods, tools, presets, and more — all in one place.

While the core platform is closed-source, this GitHub organization hosts supporting resources like:

- Documentation for creators and developers
- Tools to help integrate with the Volar platform
- APIs, SDKs, or utilities (when applicable)

We're here to support creators, not compete with them. More public resources will roll out as we grow.
