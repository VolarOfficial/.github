**Modding should be fast, fair, and accessible.**  
Weâ€™re building a better platform for creators and their content.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Volar?

Volar is a next-gen modding platform designed to make things easier for creators and players alike.  
We focus on speed, clarity, and a better overall experience â€” no bloat, no nonsense.

We're a closed-source platform, built with care and maintained by a small, dedicated team.
Our goal isnâ€™t to replace the modding scene â€” just to give it a better home.

> Volar is a subsidiary of [Venoxity Development](https://github.com/Venoxity-Development), a team focused on building practical, creator-first tools and platforms.
